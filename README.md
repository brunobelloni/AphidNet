# AphidNet

AphidNet is a Convolutional Neural Network trained with the VGG16 architecture with the weights of the imagenet competition. The classifier achieved a validation accuracy of **97.33%** when predicting 3 life stages of a _Rhopalosiphum padi_: nymph, wingless and winged.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

For the training of Convolutional Neural Network we used the **Keras** framework with **Tensorflow** as background. To speed up processing we use a GTX 760 2GB GPU together with
